# Northwestern Qiskit Hackathon 2021

## Things to do before the hackathon

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

## Deciding on a project

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/northwestern-hackathon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template. 

Talk with your team and the Coaches to come up with a good project idea that used both Qiskit and at least one of the provided data sets.

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

Great! Use whatever communication tool you prefer to stay in touch with your team. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
